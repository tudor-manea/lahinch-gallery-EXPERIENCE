    name: "James Brohan",
    birthYear: 1954,
    bio: "It’s exciting to receive new work to the gallery by a very sought-after artist.  James has been hanging his art in Lahinch Art Gallery for 20 years and it never gets old when he is delivering new work. His style and theme of paintings are a great combination.  Layers and layers of buttery creamy oil strokes across the canvas, vivid colors portray a time gone by in Irish culture and landscape. Each painting is unique and a great testament to Irish Culture and history. It’s a poignant memory of a simpler way of life in rural Ireland, the cutting of turf was so natural to our existence.  James patiently brings this old world to life and the vibrancy of his art and technique is clear and timeless. Each painting is superbly framed.  Investing in art is not just the finance but the love of great art.",

    birthYear: 1951,
    bio: "Michael was born in Dublin in 1951 and has lived in Clare, Laois and Kildare. He also spent fifteen years in the UK before returning to Ireland in 1989. He has painted in many parts of the world; the UK, Spain, France, Portugal, Africa, the US and South East Asia.\n\nHe creates a great sense of place in his works in whatever medium he chooses. He enjoys capturing the atmosphere of the Irish countryside with particular emphasis on dramatic skies and seascapes.\n\nMichael has studied at the National College of Art and Design, The Burren College of Art and the Lisdoonvarna Painting Centre. He has also worked under Trevor Geoghegan, Fergal Flanagan, James Flack and Dorothee Roberts. He recently retired from a career in banking to devote his time to his love of art, painting in watercolour and more recently in oil. His subject is invariably Ireland – its light, its atmosphere, its varied landscapes and seascapes.\n\nMichael visited Buckingham Palace in London on August 10th to personally deliver his oil painting commemorating Queen Elizabeth’s historic visit to Ireland. It will now be part of the Royal Collection which includes works by the old masters. “Its amongst many famous Paintings going back hundreds of years so its in good company”, said Michael Hanrahan as he left the palace where the Queen’s private Secretary and the Chief Clerk of the Palace held a special reception in honour of the visit. Michael is now the only living Irish Artist with work in the Royal Collection.",
